UVM Verification Projects
Unlock the potential of Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) in these two comprehensive verification projects: Asynchronous FIFO and Memory.

****Asynchronous FIFO Verification****
  Immerse yourself in the robust verification process of Asynchronous FIFO, featuring a suite of specialized UVM test cases:

    **FIFO Write-Read Test:**
      Validate the fundamental write and read operations, ensuring data integrity within the Asynchronous FIFO design.

    **FIFO Full Error Test:**
      Stress-test the FIFO's full condition, examining its behavior and error reporting mechanisms under high load.

    **FIFO Empty Error Test:**
      Explore the handling of empty conditions within the FIFO, assessing the accuracy of error reporting and system response.

    **Concurrent Write-Read Test:**
      Simulate concurrent write and read operations, evaluating the FIFO's performance under simultaneous data transactions.

    **FIFO Wr-Rd Top Sequence Test:**
      Experience a specialized test scenario utilizing a virtual sequence and sequencer, showcasing the capabilities of the Asynchronous FIFO design in a complex, orchestrated environment.

****Memory Verification****
Ensure the reliability of your Memory module through rigorous UVM test cases:

    **Simple APB Write-Read Test:**
      Validate fundamental read and write operations to guarantee the correct functioning of the Memory module.

    **APB N-Write N-Read Test:**
      Extend the verification scope with N-number of write and read operations, evaluating the module's performance under different workloads.

    **APB Multi-Sequence Test:**
      Test the memory module's resilience by running multiple sequences concurrently, simulating diverse scenarios to ensure it meets the demands of complex designs.

**Running the Test Cases**
      Execute these UVM test cases using a UVM-compliant simulator such as VCS or Questa. Leverage the provided run scripts for each test to seamlessly integrate and validate your designs.
